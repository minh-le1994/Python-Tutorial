    "\n",
    "The goal of the next two hours will be to introduce you to the basics of Python and how to implement a basic machine learning model with the help of python\n",
    "\n",
    "So what you will be able to do after this two hours is:\n",
    "1. You will be able to understand the fundamentals of programming in python.\n",
    "2. You will be able to implement very basic python code to solve easy problems.\n",
    "3. You will get to know libraries, that are commonly used to perform data science tasks with Python.\n",
    "4. You will be able to understand the fundamental and basics steps to create a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you will **not** be able to do:\n",
    "1. You will not be an expert in Python. You will not be able to code perfectly in python and you will also not gain very deep knowledge about python. To do that you need to practice, implement code yourself, let it evaluate by other people and try it out on your own.\n",
    "2. You will not be able to create highly sophisticated machine learning models to solve complicated and real problems. For that you need to put more time into it and learn also about the statistics behind a algorithm and get some intuition for the algorithm to use for a specific problem."
